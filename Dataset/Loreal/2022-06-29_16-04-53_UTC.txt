Visna shares her coming out story. "It is about amplifying difficult journeys that happened and continue to happen, reminding people that regardless of your journey, you are loved". We celebrate Visna for embracing who she is and finding joy through love. ​

​For this year's Pride, we share our platform with employees and friends of the brand so they can tell their inspiring and personal stories​.
