CRADLE TO CRADLE certified! 🙌 After years of research and working with our production team, we are excited to be the first makeup brand to receive Cradle to Cradle certification in the US - one of the most advanced measures of product sustainability!💚 All of the packaging in our Green Edition collection is made with a mix of recycled and new materials. This is just the first step on our journey towards more sustainable packaging and practices for ALL of our products by 2030 through our Conscious Together initiative!

Maybelline does not test on animals and is committed to a world without animal testing.❤️
