“Maybelline has been in my life for a very long time and as a whole, on a macro level, it is a makeup brand, but it’s a brand that empowers women. I find that so amazing to be a part of their evolution and continue to inspire and impact women and all people through their product. I think it is just so beautiful.” -@stormreid
