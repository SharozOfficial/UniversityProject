Siddartha Tytler at FDCI x Lakmé Fashion Week.

Siddartha Tytler's collection took inspiration from the art of “Sometsuke”. Sometsuke is a Japanese term referring to the technique of decorating ceramics with brush-painted designs in underglaze cobalt blue on a white ground. Transparent glaze is applied on top of this painted bisque before firing, producing a vivid shade of blue that is known in China as qinghua (literally “blue flower”).

It comprised of applique, crystal splashes, heavy sequin sheeting, ruffles and digital prints commissioned by an artist. It had something for everybody from swimwear to heavily embroidered couture lehengas.
