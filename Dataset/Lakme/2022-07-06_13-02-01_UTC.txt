Rani Padmini, also known as Padmavati, was the queen of Mewar, married to Maharawal Ratan Singh ji. She was a woman of unprecedented beauty. She was not only beautiful, but also fierce. Rani Padmini was well trained in war strategies and battlefield. This made her adept at the art of swordmanship. After her husband, Ratan Singh, was killed in battle, she walked down a secret passage within the fort that led to the Jauhar Kund. Rani Padmini was the first to jump into the Jauhar Kund, fearless and brave. 

I am so elated that @lakmesalon recreated the Luminous look, inspired by Rani Padmavati on me, from their #queentessential bridal collection. The experts gave me open, soft curls and for the makeup, they went with a reverse eyeliner and heavy gold smokey, shimmer eyes. The stunning jewellery completed the look and I am so happy about how this turned out to be.
