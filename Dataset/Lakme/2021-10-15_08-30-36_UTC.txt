#TheAwakening by Lakm√© Salon x Chola at FDCI x Lakm√© Fashion Week was a celebration of letting go, being uninhibited, and being our most authentic selves „Ä∞Ô∏è

The classic mullet features shorter hair in the front, sides, & crown with a longer length at the back. For the runway, our #BackstageHeroes played up this two-toned mullet with texture at the crown. Coupled with a reverse ombre eye color and glossy lips, this look screams new beginnings. ‚ú®
