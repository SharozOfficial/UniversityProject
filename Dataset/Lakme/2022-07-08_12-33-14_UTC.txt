Presenting Rara Avis by Sonal Verma and Shruti Sancheti at FDCI x Lakmé Fashion Week.

Rara Avis by Sonal Verma's collection 'Hodophilic' at FDCI X Lakmé Fashion Week was a reflection of all those thoughts that come together to make you feel alive. The collection featured silhouettes that are buoyant yet easy. There was a strong play of colours amongst which tonal embroidered details stood out with the use of old traditional Indian techniques. The jewellery line was made of only natural stones. It was an extension of the sensibility that is contemporary & sublime, echoing the ethos of the brand.

Shruti Sancheti's collection 'Alchemy' was an ode to those who know that the magical thing about home is that even though it feels good to leave, it feels even better to come back. Using Laborious techniques from the Mughal era coupled with delicate details handcrafted by craftsmen - the collection promised pieces that carry a timeless appeal. This was the personification of Slow fashion, with a look that is global combined with a soul that is totally indigenous. Sustainable, detail-oriented, and a celebration of the unsurpassed legacy of craft and textiles of India sums up her exquisite line.
