She looks like a true diva with a glittery blend of cherry and champagne in her eyeshadow, a stroke of eyeliner and luscious eyelashes, complete with a shimmery green under-eye to compliment her outfit. Her pink lips with an elegant middle-parted bun infused with roses and few loose strands, add to her regality. Red nails with gold embellishments are just the perfect match for her outfit!
