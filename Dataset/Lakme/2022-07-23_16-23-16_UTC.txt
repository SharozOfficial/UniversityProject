Bhavashankari was a Bengali queen from Bhurisrestha kingdom who defeated the Pathans and established Hindu sovereignty along with power, prosperity and grandeur.
Maharani Bhavashankari became famous by her title Raibaghini, who gradually came to denote a courageous or sometimes rebellious woman and became a part of Bengali proverb. Her story of valour became a part of folklore and were immortalised by ballads and village poets.
