This Princess is remembered as the lady who embraced western education, etiquette and oriental elegance. Princess Niloufer was one of the most beautiful women in the world. Her photos appeared on the cover pages of magazines. Even before television and beauty pageants could begin their reign over public imagination, Princess Niloufer’s exquisite looks and sense of style were talking points across the country and in the cities of Europe. Niloufer was the “Kohinoor of Hyderabad”.
I am glad that I got a chance from @lakmesalon to portray this amazing Queen. This look is called Ethereal. Curled  hair with soft makeup is making this so Divine.
