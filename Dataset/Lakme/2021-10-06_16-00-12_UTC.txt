As the lockdowns ease and we start to step out into the world again, our sense of life, normalcy and style has changed, perhaps irrevocably. With artful styles from Sohaya Misra’s @chola_the_label with hair cut, color, styles, and makeup from @lakmesalon, India’s leading salon brand, we voice this shift of consciousness as we embrace the new normal. 

Witness as we reflect on the evolution that we’re all currently experiencing in this trendsetting collaboration to embrace the new “you”, more free-spirited and authentic than ever before. Witness The Awakening.
