Extracting natural colours from soil, water and air ðŸ¦ 

Indian fashion designer @ka_sha_india collaborated with our innovator @kbcolssciences â€” a biotech studio that produces sustainable natural colours from living microorganisms!

The collection, designed and created for @fdciofficial x @lakmefashionwk 2022 in India, is called Manthan and celebrates water and its quality of acting plurally: ever changing, yet calm, shapeless, yet creating shape and an important factor in both life and death. The pieces exhibited are embellished with hand-embroidered fish and reference marine life with a natural colour palette using hand-dyed fabrics from the innovator.

Curious to see it up close? The creations are part of our current exhibition, Fashion Week: A New Era, at the Fashion for Good Museum â€” head to the link in our bio to book tickets âœ¨
