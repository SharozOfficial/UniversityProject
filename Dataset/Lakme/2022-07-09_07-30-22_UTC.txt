Rise Worldwide x Fashion For Good present Innovation for Circularity featuring Divyam Mehta, Ka-sha & Nitin Bal Chauhan at FDCI X Lakmé Fashion Week. 

@r1seworldwide & @fashionforgood joined hands to catalyse collaborations between supply chain disruptors and designers to present collections that spotlight Innovations for Circular fashion. 

@divyammehta took on a poetic spin on the Dongria Kondh tribe silhouettes that reflect a rural life, culture and simple living, in tune with nature. The fabrics came from AltMat, an enterprise that develops textiles from agricultural waste. Drapes, hybrid patterns, hand tailoring, kantha work are some of the key elements of this capsule collection. 

@ka_sha_india’s collection, “Manthan” took its inspiration from the paradoxical nature of water that is ever-changing. The surfaces of the pieces represented the many layers of water, both tangible and intangible with the help of hand-dyeing using KB cols Sciences’ microbial fermentation technology and non-GMO naturally occurring coloured microbes. This collection was made in cotton of differing weights that are appliqued, embroidered and pleated to bring to life the designer's inspiration. 

@nitinbalchauhan came up with a conceptual collection, “Countdown” designed to raise awareness on how our collective action and non-sustainable growth is leading our planet to a point of no return, at an alarming speed. The collection addressed grave issues like urbanisation, deforestation, air pollution, that resulted in increased alarming diseases. It used Graviky’s AirInk for printing & painting; ink that is made from carbon, collected from vehicles, chimneys, etc.
