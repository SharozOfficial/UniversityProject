Presenting NEXA presents Tarun Tahiliani Luxury Pret at FDCI x Lakme Fashion Week.

@nexaexperience presents @taruntahiliani Luxury Pret at FDCI X Lakmé Fashion Week was a beautiful expression of modern India and is global at the same time. It shows the amalgamation of modern and traditional silhouettes as well as drapes with technology and aerodynamics. Here, structured draping marries tech. There were prints in the collection, which have been distorted and recreated in the most beautiful textiles. Innovative at its core, the textiles in this collection have been woven with a Zari thread and Resham to create metallic textured sheen and look like molten metals. This collection iwas a new take on the future generation that is confident, experimental, has fashion in its roots and values avant-garde design.
