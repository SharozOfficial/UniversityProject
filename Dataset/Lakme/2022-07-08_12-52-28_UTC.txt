ðŸ‘‘âœ¨This Divine look is inspired by Rani Sita Devi, also known as Princess Karam, the daughter of Maharaja of Kashipur. Rani Sita Devi was well known for her classic and iconic sense of style.ðŸ‘‘âœ¨

This Maharani belonged to an era when most Indian women, even royalty, were photographed with their heads demurely covered. Yet she, with her exquisite beauty and style, entranced European society and quickly became a fashion icon during the Jazz Age.

I love the way Lakme Salon experts recreated this look on me.  This is a Divine Look. Inspired by Sita Devi. 
They did:
Hair: Peeled out long braid
Makeup: Translucent skin, copper and berry expressive eyes, nude lip
