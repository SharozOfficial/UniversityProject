Your Lakmé Salon family wishes you a happy #WorldEnvironmentDay.
There’s only one planet and there’s only one you, let’s take care of both to #BeautifyTheFuture.

We, at Lakmé Salon, have been making continuous effort to save the planet.
From switching to energy-efficient LED lights and special water nozzles that reduce wastage by 50% to setting the AC at optimal 24° C for lesser electricity consumption and utilizing 66% of recycled paper for all our marketing collaterals, we are doing our part.
What about you?
