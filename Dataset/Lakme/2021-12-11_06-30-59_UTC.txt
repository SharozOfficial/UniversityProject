#GenNextBride | The Glowing Goddess Look is the embodiment of timeless grace and a modern aesthetic. It channels the traditional Indian bride with a touch of contemporary style.

The contrast between @ridhisamrat’s vermillion outfit by @studybyjanak, emerald jewellery by @multanijewellersooficial and the bride’s glass-glow skin aptly express her individuality, while staying true to tradition. Her sharp, statement brows and sculpted, glossy lips paired with a deep berry and pink gradient eyeshadow with luscious mink lashes and kohl-rimmed eyes all come together to accentuate her ensemble. The open hair, crimped for volume with a Sheepatti to crown the look makes her look like a perfect match for @ashishfashionmilitary.
