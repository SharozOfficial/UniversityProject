#TheAwakening by Lakmé Salon x Chola was a celebration of letting go, being uninhibited, and being our most authentic selves at FDCI x Lakmé Fashion Week. 〰️

This look is a play on the long bob, a versatile haircut that suits all hair types—from curly to messy--and one that  oozes femininity. The chic yet fun lob stands out with the use of vivid orange and yellow to form a chic burnt caramel. The makeup looks ramp-ready with a delicious melon wash on the eyes and glossy lips.💄
