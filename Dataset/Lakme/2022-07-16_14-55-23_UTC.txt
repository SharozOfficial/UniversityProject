John Jacob presents Shivan and Narresh at FDCI X Lakmé Fashion Week.

Shivan and Narresh’s Fresconian Series at the FDCI X Lakmé Fashion Week was all about reimagining the visual splendor of Shekhawati Havelis in Rajasthan, painting to life India's opulent history and evolution through the modern lens of art and design. The contemporarisation of the mural musings and their new-age relevance in documenting and eternalizing the Shekhawati history and the lives of the people at that time enamors and inspires a modern canvas for the Fresconian Series. 5 prints were used in this collection which pay an ode to the artist as well as the artisans, exuding joy and creativity through poetic blends of shimmering skein luster and meticulous detailing. Hand-techniques such as hand knitting, crochet, hand-machine embroidery and shuttle needle-lace technique hero the intricacy of each garment.
