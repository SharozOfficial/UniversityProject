This look is called 𝐆𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐞𝐟𝐮𝐥 inspired by "Gayatri Devi"

Gayatri Devi was considered to be one of the most beautiful women in the world. Maharani Gayatri Devi was the epitome of grace and a fashion icon with a classic sense of style that beautifully married Indian and European cultures. The look recreated on me from the Queentessential collection by @lakmesalon is inspired by her. 

I got to portray 'Gayatri Devi' for a day with Lakmé Salon, and I'm ecstatic and overwhelmed. The experts at @lakmesalon  gave me a long bob with beachy waves, and stunning minimal make up with pink, shimmery eyeshadow, winged eyeliner and glossy lips.
