Presenting Bata X Suneet Verma at FDCI X Lakmé Fashion Week  Bata X Suneet Varma's collection, ""The eternal lightness of being” was carefully crafted in stylish & easy silhouettes. The black, red & colourful thread embroidered pieces are languid in silhouettes & the crinkled chiffon, crushed georgette & sheer organza create caressing textures. The ensembles in this collection celebrated life & living in the moment which can be used from day to night with just a twist in styling.
