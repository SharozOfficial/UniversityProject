#GenNextBride | The Peach Princess Look is for the understated, day bride. 

The modern design of the outfit by @studybyjanak paired with @radhikaandneenusaartistry’s traditional Kundan jewellery brings in the best of the two worlds. @aneesha.prakashh’s natural, glowing skin with bronze accents and pink highlights keeps it classy with a hint of sparkle. Voluminous mink eyelashes and orange-red, sculpted lips complement the bride’s neat bun and striking Maang Tikka.
