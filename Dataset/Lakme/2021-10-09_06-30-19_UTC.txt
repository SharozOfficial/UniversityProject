#TheAwakening by LakmÃ© Salon x Chola was a celebration of letting go, being uninhibited, and being our most authentic selves at FDCI x LakmÃ© Fashion Week.

This look is the modern-day, money piece take on the otherwise carefree, irreverent Modern Shag. With hair contouring to frame the face and a touch of color in the fringe area, this hairstyle is sure to turn heads. Coupled with glass-glow skin, a sexy reversed smokey eye, and a luscious lip stain, this look is perfect to break free, post lockdown! ðŸŒŸ

Love this look? ðŸ’– Don it yourself at Safer Than Home* LakmÃ© Salon!
