#LakmeSalonXWedMeGood | Our first look from Mumbai is a jhakaas/thaskebaaz Marathi ensemble that celebrates age-old customs with a contemporary zing! 

She wears a beautiful traditional Nauvari or nine yard saree, a full chuda, and graceful makeup and hair make her the quintessential Marathi bride. Her natural-looking glass glow skin with a pink-ish shimmery eyeshadow and long mink lashes are complete with the perfect red lip and the traditional Chandrakor bindi. While she dons her full chuda, her nails steal the show with a contemporary nail makeover. A stylised bun with red roses, a traditional nose ring, and mundavlya add grace to her classic ensemble!
