#Repost • @ritcha || Got myself a makeover yesterday - a hair cut and global colour at @lakmesalon @lakmesalon_vashi, who is bringing the latest trends from Lakmé Fashion Week to men and women all over the country to make them runway ready. I love the colour that complements my skin tone so well and the gradual layers that frame my face! Haven't they done a fab job on me? 💕

They are bringing their backstage expertise to the salon with personalized consultations and a range of cut, colour and form services across different age groups, lifestyles and palates for both men & women on the occasion of Good Hair Day. They have the hottest hair trends/techniques like balayage and ombre, face-framing cuts and shags. 💇🏻‍♀️

What also really impressed me were the 55 enhanced safety and hygiene measures that they have implemented in their salons, in consultation with medical professionals for the utmost safety of the staff and customers. I got a first hand experience of it.
