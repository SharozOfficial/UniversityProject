This look is called Graceful inspired by "Gayatri Devi"

Gayatri Devi was considered to be one of the most beautiful women in the world. Maharani Gayatri Devi was the epitome of grace and a fashion icon with a classic sense of style that beautifully married Indian and European cultures. The look recreated on me from the Queentessential collection by Lakmé Salon is inspired by her. 

I got to portray 'Gayatri Devi' for a day with @lakmesalon, and I'm ecstatic and overwhelmed. The experts at Lakmé Salon gave me a long bob with beachy waves, and stunning minimal make up with pink, shimmery eyeshadow, winged eyeliner and glossy lips.
