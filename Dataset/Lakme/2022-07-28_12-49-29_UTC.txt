Princess Niloufer was one of the top ten beautiful women of the world. Her photos appeared in the cover pages of magazines.
Much before television, beauty pageants and glamour rags could begin their reign over the public imagination, yet Princess Niloufer’s exquisite looks and clothes were a talking point across the country and in the cities of Europe. Niloufer was the “Kohinoor of Hyderabad”
