Bemberg™ Presents Payal Pratap at FDCI X Lakmé Fashion Week.  Payal Pratap took a nostalgic journey with this collection aptly named “JAVA”. With a focus on prints, the designer has worked on hand painted artworks which have then been digitized. The designs capture detailed elements and a three-dimensional depth and texture from the age-old crafts of Batik and powerful imagery and minute detailing from the ancient craft of Chintz printing. 

The prints encompassed of flora and fauna, bringing nature from the outside to the inside through the use of extensive flower, leaf, tree, vines and bird motives, as an ode to sustainability. Bemberg in various avatars ranging from satins, muslins, mulmul, and silk blends have been used to create a collection with fluid drapes as well as structure. The line of clothing features bold prints & large floral patterns and  is clearly a return to maximalism, reminiscent of the good old days.
