#BackstageHeroes || “In the 10 years I’ve been at Lakmé Salon, I’ve grown from being a trainee to a Backstage Hero, which is a big deal for me. Not only have I become a better professional at Lakmé Salon, but the soft skills’ trainings I’ve received over the years has also helped develop my personality outside of work. The highlight of my career, of course, has been working backstage at Lakmé Fashion Week multiple times. I think those were some of the best days of my life. I started by assisting the trainers and today, I have assistants when working backstage. The energy there is amazing. You get a great deal of exposure and also get to learn so much; things you may not learn in salon. My journey with Lakmé Salon has been full of learnings. My next goal is to become a Hair Trainer, which I’m confident will happen in the next couple of years.”
