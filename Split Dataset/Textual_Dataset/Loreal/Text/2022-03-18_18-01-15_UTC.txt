We are proud to speak about our sustainability program ‘L’Oréal for the Future, Because our planet is worth it’, while marking the occasion of #RecyclingDay.

In terms of concrete action this means that:
✅ We are working to reduce carbon emissions by 50% per product, by 2030.
✅ We will be investing 10 million euros in environmental projects around the world to help and benefit communities of women.
