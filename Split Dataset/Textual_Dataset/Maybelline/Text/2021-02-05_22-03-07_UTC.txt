Black is resilient. In honor of Black History Month, we are proud to partner with @makeitblackofficial by bringing back our bestselling #superstaymatteink liquid lipstick in ‘thrill seeker’. Through this partnership we’ll be making a donation to the @pullupforchange Impact Fund in direct support of emerging Black entrepreneurs and Black founders. This limited edition “Make It Black” packaging is to celebrate the beauty of the Black community. ⠀

Thank you @heysharonc for creating this initiative and we’re so honored to be part of this movement. Our limited edition ‘thrill seeker’ shade is available for the month of February only online @ultabeauty. #makeitblackchallenge #makeitblack
