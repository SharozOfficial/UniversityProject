"Mama, I am a rich man 💅🏻

We’re often reminded by this patriarchal society that when women want MORE in life they’re arrogant, conceited and selfish. If a man wanted MORE, he would simply be “bound for success” 🙄

I will always strive to do MORE than what is expected of me as an artist and a woman. And what better way to start taking charge of our lives than putting on your fave air-light, plush-matte and super pigmented Maybelline Ultimatte! Cis men will never know the power we hold when we feel and look our best 😉🤪

There’s 10 beautiful, morena-friendly shades! My favorite is MORE MAUVE 💗 You deserve to feel like luxury because you are worth just as much and more 💎

Realtalk: i swear by this product, best formula by Maybelline yet. If I haven’t convinced you i swear I will come to your house and put it on your lips 🤣

Available on Shopee and Lazada for just P299 🛒 "
