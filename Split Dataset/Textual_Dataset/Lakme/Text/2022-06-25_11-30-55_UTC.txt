Presenting Diksha Khanna at FDCI X Lakmé Fashion Week.

@diksha.khanna's collection titled “Julley”, or ""Hello"" in Ladakhi was inspired by the barren landscape of Ladakh. The trans-seasonal & fluid line entails traditional costumes that were interpreted in insightful shapes, and dexterous detailing, making ensembles, mostly androgynous. She went back to the roots to explore eco-printing, a form of natural dyeing on textiles, to extract the natural beauty of plants & foliage.
