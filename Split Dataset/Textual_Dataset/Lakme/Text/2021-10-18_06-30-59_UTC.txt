#TheAwakening by Lakmé Salon x Chola at FDCI x Lakmé Fashion Week was a celebration of letting go, being uninhibited, and being our most authentic selves 〰️

The long layered braided look embraces the natural texture of the hair with roasted almond highlights to add softness and warmth. Longer hair is interlaced with cornrows and twists to add to the quirky look. Sharp winged eyeliner with glossy lips and dewy skin complements the look, making it the perfect stunner, whether on the runway or the streets. 💃🏻
