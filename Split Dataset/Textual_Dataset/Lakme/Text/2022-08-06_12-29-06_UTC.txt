realme presents Shantnu and Nikhil at the FDCI X Lakmé Fashion Week

The collection, “nomad” was a new direction, a way of looking at design as a responsibility, as well as a great power. With this collection, the designers seek to turn the art of design into a weapon, a tool, and a refuge, and through it, to imagine newer, more hopeful worlds and to cast our minds into the future.

This collection brought all that was happening around us through symbols, textures, silhouettes, and motifs. There were sweaters in rough knits that seem like they were made of rope-yarn, suited to a breezy beachside, while classic intarsia featuring large leopard spots were cut into voluminous jackets for the urban jungle. There were huge bags and vintage fisher hats, alluding to the constant Nomad in all of us, while puffer jackets and studded harnesses coalesce comfort and couture.
