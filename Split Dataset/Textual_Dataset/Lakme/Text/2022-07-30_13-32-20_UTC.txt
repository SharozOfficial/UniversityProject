Pramaa by Pratima Pandey at FDCI X Lakmé Fashion Week.

Inspired from the eternally beautiful “Paro” – Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay’s protagonist from his classic novel Devdas (1917), @pramaabypratimapandey's new collection was a way to reinvent Paro’s demeanour and discover her fiery side. The classic cuts from 1920s in layering were explored in handwoven silk chanderi and Maheshwari with delicate flora-fauna embroidery.
