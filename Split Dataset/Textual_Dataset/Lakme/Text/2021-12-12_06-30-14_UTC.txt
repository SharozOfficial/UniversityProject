#GenNextBride | The Shimmery Showstopper Look is for the modern bride who is ready to rule the mandap like the runway on her special day!

@theshivanichaudhary embraces her individuality while paying tribute to her favourite traditions with a contemporary lehenga by @studybyjanak and jewellery by @multanijewellersofficial. Her soft, glass-glow skin and eyes highlighted with pink, peach and a pop of champagne, paired with peach-pink blush, adds a charming rosy tinge to her look. An elegant low ponytail played up with a Maang Tikka adds elegance to her ensemble.
