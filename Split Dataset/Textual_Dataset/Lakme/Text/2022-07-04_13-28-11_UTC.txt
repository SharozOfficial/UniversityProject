Presenting R|Elan™️ X Satya Paul by Rajesh Pratap Singh at FDCI X Lakmé Fashion Week.

In collaboration with R|Elan™️, Satya Paul by Rajesh Pratap Singh showcased "New Order" - a collection that spells Evening with a capital E & reminds us of the power of art. The smart & sustainable fabrics provided by R|Elan™️ gives flight to their line's flow. Music, fashion and the right to creative expression belong in the streets and public institutions. Breaking free with all due respect, the collection urges us to be reminded that we have the right to dance in the office. Inspiration is taken from the work of Klimt, Muccha and Toulouse Lautrec at the time when art nouveau emerged as resistance and they demanded through their work a return to nature.
