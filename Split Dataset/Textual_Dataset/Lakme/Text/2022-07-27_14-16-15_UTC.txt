This look is 'Maverick' and is inspired by 'Queen Indradevi'.

Indradevi was a queen of the Khmer Empire through her marriage to king Jayavarman.
She was the daughter of ‘kshatriyas, amongst the elite of the royal family’.
Her mind was louder than her beauty. She was Cambodia's most beautiful woman and has always been kind to people.

I am glad that I got a chance to portray this beautiful Queen by @lakmesalon.
Open curls with peach shimmery eyes, winged liner and Glossy lips are the highlights of this look.
