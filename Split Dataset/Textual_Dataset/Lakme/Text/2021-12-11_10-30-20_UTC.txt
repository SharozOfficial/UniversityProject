#GenNextBride | The Smokey Starlet Look is for the bride who believes in comfort and tradition. This look highlights your natural features for an outcome that’s beyond stunning.
 
With a modern-cut lehenga by @studybyjanak, @multanijewellersofficial’s breathtaking jewels and a neat, pulled-back hairstyle, @meghnadutt surely makes a statement. This look features stand-out eyes with mink lashes, berry-black eyeshadow and champagne pop highlights for a bold, smokey eye look. Minimalist, natural-looking skin with soft peach highlights and pink lips will leave you looking beautiful and baraat-ready! To complete the look, a low bun parted in the middle for the Maang Tikka keeps it simple yet striking.
