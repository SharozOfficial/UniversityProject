Atelier Opening: Outhouse at FDCI X Lakmé Fashion Week

Outhouse’s collection, “OH Dopamine” was all about celebrating a strong sense of self expression in an unapologetic way. From an idyllic escape into the world of fantasies to an eclectic sense of being one’s unapologetic self, the designers rediscovered the joys in the little memories from their past by diving into the exuberant spirit of the 2000's. Encapsulating the very essence of the Y2K era, the line featured colourful beads, resin, seed beads, raffia, and even enamel with each creation having its own individualistic charm. Echoing the strong voice of the collection, the pieces are an interplay as a motley of silver plating combined with matte silver along with crystals and rhinestones. Their exceptional craftsmanship shone through their exquisite handbags shining bright with metallic undertones.
