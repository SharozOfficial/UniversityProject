@tencel_luxe presents JJV BY JJ Valaya’s collection, "Rumeli~The Summer Story” at FDCI X Lakmé Fashion Week was engineered with a sensitivity towards sustainability. 

This year, as the luxury occasion wear brand celebrates its 30th year in fashion, it takes a step further by launching its all-new bridge-to-luxury brand, JJV. The new brand debuted with an eco-conscious collection made from TENCEL™️ LUXE filament yarn which is a sustainable, eco-friendly and vegan alternative to silk. Derived from renewable wood sources in a closed loop lyocell process, TENCEL™️ LUXE filament yarn is set to define the landscape of luxury fashion with its silky smoothness, liquid-like drape, color vibrancy and yarn strength. JJV is an occasion wear brand that revolves around the spirit of travel & with this exquisite line it embraces the need, where one can still maintain a unique sense of personal style without the use of any heavy embroideries.
