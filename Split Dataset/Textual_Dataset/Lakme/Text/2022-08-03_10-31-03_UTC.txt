NEXA presents “The Spotlight” featuring Two Point Two at the FDCI X Lakmé Fashion Week.

This collection, 'Behind the doors' was an ode to that very faith to remind us that hope exists, compassion exists, solidarity exists, camaraderie exists and above all love exists. It was a reflection of our time during the pandemic and how we survived and continue to emerge from it. Made with sustainable organic textiles developed from fibres of rose petals, orange, lotus and organic cotton, this line was a true testament to the importance of saving the planet by finding sustainable alternatives in fashion. The details and silhouettes of this collection reflected an amalgamation of our urge to travel and the time spent at home.
