Presenting @rannagill at FDCI X Lakmé Fashion Week

The ebullient collection, “Casablanca Calling” celebrated ‘Marrakesh’. Inspired by exquisite fashion, intricate designs and glorious spice markets – the designer presented a modern, playful collection of dreamy drapes and statement prints in vibrant jewel tones. Effervescent prints of Uzbek motifs, florals, paisleys, and stripes, when combined with the luxurious textures of metallic georgettes, brocade and crispy cotton; created a confluence of a mystically wondrous world – exemplifying the grandeur of Morocco.The pieces in the collection embodied Gill’s love for powerful and timeless styles, in myriad of colors and playful silhouettes. Effortless resort wear in opulent hues of spices, took form of corset, dresses, bustiers and twirl-worthy full circle skirts which are impeccable.
