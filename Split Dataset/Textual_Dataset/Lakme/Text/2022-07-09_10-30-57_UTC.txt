Presenting Rajdeep Ranawat at FDCI x Lakmé Fashion Week. 

Rajdeep Ranawat presented a journey to the Orient Express. Bringing together unusual multicoloured prints, fabrics, bizarre silks and ingenious embroideries, the designer clashes them fearlessly as his oriental inspired clothing weaves stories of opulence and exoticism. The prints capture the clear orient skies and the distinct sketches of oriental pagodas in parts and lull you with a zen like calmness with their simplicity.
