She was a Lingayat, a devotee of Lord Shiva. She belonged to a merchant family from Kundapur, Karnataka. She was beautiful, pious, and virtuous. With a pearl-like complexion, broad forehead, curly hair, and bright eyes, an aura of divinity emanated from her. She was Chennamma. Chennamma ruled the kingdom of Keladi for 25 years. The beautiful queen had the ability to kill her enemies in battle, like Durga (the goddess of power). Beauty, valour, piety and generosity all blended within this great Queen.

@lakmeSalon experts recreated the look Effervescent inspired by Chennamma, from their #Queentessential bridal collection. The experts at Lakme Salon gave me beautiful curls, smokey eyes, and to complete the look I wore beautiful jewellery.
