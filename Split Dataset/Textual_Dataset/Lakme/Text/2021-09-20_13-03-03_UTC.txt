#BackstageHeroes || "Many years ago, I worked with Lakmé Salon but had to move out due to personal reasons. I couldn’t stay away for too long -- within two years, I was back and have been here for five years now. I’ve learnt so much here; there’s no way I would have learnt this much and grown as a professional at any other salon company. Lakmé Salon also offers job security, which helps us be the best versions of ourselves and better our skills every year. After becoming a Backstage Hero, for which my colleagues, managers and trainers encouraged me to apply, my next goal is to become a Hair Trainer. I’ve learnt so much here and I enjoy teaching, so now I want to pass this on to other aspiring stylists. So far, the company has been extremely supportive, hence I have no doubt that I will achieve this goal in the next few years.”
