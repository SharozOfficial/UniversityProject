Presenting Punit Balana at FDCI x Lakmé Fashion Week.

Designer Punit Balana’s new collection, “Lakshmi” took inspiration from the journey of a young, urbane, cosmopolitan girl, Lakshmi who is well travelled, has explored the world, yet is very rooted. The collection is an artistic expression which beautifully blends culture and art form deeply rooted in Rajasthan. The ensembles are replete with bold motifs in Rajasthani natural vegetable dye using Kalamkari & ajrak technique on luscious chanderi silk rendering a surrealistic vision. Explorative & layered metallic embroidery on prints & solid tones, using coins, thread & mirror breathes magic into diaphanous palates of neutrals, tones of henna and earthy hues. A sense of fluidity and ease with movement was the core of Balana’s new collection. Each and every ensemble has been designed to be moved, danced and celebrated in.
