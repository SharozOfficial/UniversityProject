#BackstageHeroes || “I hail from Kanpur, UP, where the brand name of Lakmé Salon is a big deal. When I decided I wanted to get into the beauty field, I knew that doing my course at Lakmé Academy Powered by Aptech (LAPA) would be the best option for my career. I was lucky enough to learn it all -- skin, hair and makeup, but I soon realised that I wanted to specialise in skin therapy. Though my goal has always been to someday become a trainer with Lakmé Salon, my managers and trainers encouraged me to first work on the floor to gain knowledge and experience, and I’m so glad they did. Not only am I better skilled now, but my confidence has also vastly increased since I first joined Lakmé Salon in 2019. In 2020, I even became a Dermalogica-certified skin therapist and have so far participated in two ProSkin Master competitions, reaching the final rounds both times. I want to work hard and further hone my skills over the next year or two and to become a trainer, and with Lakmé Salon’s support, I’m sure that will happen.”
