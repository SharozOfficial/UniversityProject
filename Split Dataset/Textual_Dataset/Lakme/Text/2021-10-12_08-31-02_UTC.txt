#TheAwakening by Lakmé Salon x Chola at FDCI x Lakmé Fashion Week was a celebration of letting go, being uninhibited, and being our most authentic selves 〰️
The edgy, cool-girl pixie do was back on the runway to add some sugar and spice. The shades of bright green color added a touch of quirk, along with soft bangs, a different hair parting, volume and texture. Bold, smokey eyes and dewy skin completed the look, giving it an edgy, modern vibe. 💫
