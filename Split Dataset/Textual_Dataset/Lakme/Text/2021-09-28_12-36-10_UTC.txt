#BackstageHeroes || "I joined Lakmé Salon in 2010 as an Assistant Salon Manager but only really learnt about and got motivated to work in the business in 2012. Within the next two years, I was promoted to Salon Manager and today I’m an Area Business Executive, on my way to become an Area Business Manager. The most valuable lesson Lakmé Salon taught was to break down goals and tasks to make them more achievable and to celebrate even the smallest of wins. I’ve been able to apply this to my personal life as well, along with the communications training I’ve received over the years. When I joined, I didn't know much about the salon industry and my spoken English wasn’t fluent either. But instead of highlighting my weaknesses, this company took my strengths and built on them. My next goal is to become a Zonal Business Manager and everyone who knows me knows that I plan to retire at Lakmé Salon."
