#LakmeSalonXWedMeGood | When your lehenga is contemporary with jewelry that looks khandaani, it’s obvious that you’re a Lucknowi #GenNextBride! 

With a peachy glow that complements her outfit, this bride is all about her eyes -- smoldering, smokey eyes, a pretty pink crease and mink lashes. Her pink lips and Maang Tikka make this look the perfect balance between playful and traditional. To further accentuate this playfulness, her hair is free-flowing in a half bun adorned with angel’s breath to keep it simple yet stunning!
