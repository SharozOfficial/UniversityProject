This luminous look is inspired by Queen Padmavati, also known as Rani Padmini üëë‚ú®
A Queen that was not only beautiful but fierce.

She was a legendary queen & wife of King Rawal Ratan Singh of Chittor (Mewar). Rani Padmini was known mostly for her divine beauty and Jauhar (self-immolation) in 1303, the year Alauddin Khilji attacked Chittor.

I feel elated to have been a part of @lakmesalon #Queentessential this year.
For the makeup, the experts went ahead with reverse eyeliner, heavy gold smokey and shimmery eyes and for the hair Open, soft curls to complement the whole look.
Not to forget the beautiful outfit and the stunning jewellery that bought the whole look together.‚ù§Ô∏è
